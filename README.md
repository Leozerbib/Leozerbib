👋 Hey there! I’m Leo Zerbib — a passionate 🦾 fullstack developer from Paris 🇫🇷.

🚀 I graduated with a Master’s in Computer Science from ISEP (2022–2025), after smashing through two years of maths & physics prep.
👨‍💻 I spent two years working at Ariane Group, building, debugging, and learning something new every day.

🛠️ Tech I'm great at:
  🌐 JavaScript / TypeScript
  ⚛️ React & Next.js
  🐍 Python
  ☕ Java & Spring Boot
  🐘 PostgreSQL
  🐳 Docker
  🐧 Linux
  ⚡ NestJS, Supabase, GCP, Proxmox

🔢 Built cool things:
  📱 SpotMap: A mobile app mapping the world around you
  🤖 Gile: AI-powered project management
  🛰️ 3D satellite FPV simulator
  🚤 Autonomous waste-collection boat
  🧪 Sensor-based lie detector + web app
  🏡 Self-hosted cloud server (Proxmox/Docker)

✨ I love challenges, creative solutions, and building things that work.
🌱 Always learning — let’s connect, code, and create!
